      "message": "so i still don\u0027t understand why we have this. we added euc-jp-2007\u0027s converter to our .dat file but we\u0027re avoiding using it here? can\u0027t we just get in sync with upstream on convrtrs.txt now? or should we remove euc-jp-2007 from icu-data-default.txt because that was only added to work around the fact that this file was more screwed up in earlier patchsets?",

      "message": "Good point.  Markus suggested that euc-jp-2007 is safer than ibm-954_P101-2007, so we should probably use euc-jp-2007 as the target for EUC-JP and the other below. \n\nI agree that it\u0027s time for a review of all the differences in this file, with the goal of making it compatible.  Who can best evaluate the diffs?",

      "message": "I think we should use euc-jp-2007. Public ICU has split the aliases between ibm-954 and the new table, we should mostly take that split but compare with the previous Android patches.\n\nAnother question is whether we can \u0026 should drop the ibm-954 conversion table, and move its aliases to the new table. Java might ask for ibm-954, but I doubt it (or doubt that we care).\n\nJungshik is our current charset guru. I will help too.",
