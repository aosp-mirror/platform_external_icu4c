      "message": "so i still don\u0027t understand why we have this. we added euc-jp-2007\u0027s converter to our .dat file but we\u0027re avoiding using it here? can\u0027t we just get in sync with upstream on convrtrs.txt now? or should we remove euc-jp-2007 from icu-data-default.txt because that was only added to work around the fact that this file was more screwed up in earlier patchsets?",

      "message": "Good point.  Markus suggested that euc-jp-2007 is safer than ibm-954_P101-2007, so we should probably use euc-jp-2007 as the target for EUC-JP and the other below. \n\nI agree that it\u0027s time for a review of all the differences in this file, with the goal of making it compatible.  Who can best evaluate the diffs?",
